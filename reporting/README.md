# Reporting

To have an overview about running migrations, finished migrations or migrations errors, RealMigrator offers a reporting tool. This tool is **Reporting** - a menu with different filters to create various reports.

For further evaluations and analyses, reports are downloadable (as CSV and TSV) and customizable (via script).
