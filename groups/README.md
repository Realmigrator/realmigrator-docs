# Groups

With a group, it is possible to unify migrations for more than one client. The use of a group makes migration more comfortable.

The chapter **Groups** has different functions. A (super) administrator can select a date of migration. It is possible to select the modules which must be part of a migration and which not. Of course, adding groups is part of this menu too.
