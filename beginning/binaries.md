This example above shows a script for the binary **backup/module.chai**.

A detail overview contains information about last modification, content-type, content-length, an ETag and a MD5.\
Additionally, the script is shown as well. It is possible to edit this script manually with a click into the script field. A click on the **Save** button will save the edits.

With a click on the **Open** button, the script will open in a new tab. It is not possible to edit a script in this tab.

### Delete a script

If a script is no longer necessary or incorrect, it is possible to delete it. Click **Delete** in the upper-right corner to delete a script.
