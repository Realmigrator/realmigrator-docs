# Introduction

With RealMigrator it is possible to migrate anything and everything to Microsoft 365. RealMigrator helps to solve any roadblocks when migrating to Windows 10, by offering detailed asset inventory, local as well as home share data migration to OneDrive including files and folders, and in addition local PST detection and migration to Office 365 Mailboxes.

RealMigrator is a single file application running in user mode. Based on a flexible set of configurations, RealMigrator will start to analyze the local machine to prepare an ongoing and controlled upload. When finished, the client can easily get a fresh setup of Windows 10 without losing user data.

It is possible to deploy RealMigrator with preferred deployment strategy, whether that be Login Script, GPO, SCCM, or even by mail, and get instant information about all assets and data to migrate. An individual configuration for groups or locations starts afterwards to synchronize all user documents and settings, IE favorites, PST-files and anything else to its future destination, like OneDrive, Exchange Online and Azure.

During Migration, there is no user disturbance. An optional tray icon signals the work in progress and informs about the state of a device on request, but everything happens fully automated in the background with taking care of bandwidth-throttling and metered connection. The sync watches for document changes and works continuously.

The following documentation gives a detailed overview about RealMigrator.
