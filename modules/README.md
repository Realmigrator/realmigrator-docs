# Modules

Configure and edit RealMigrator modules before starting a migration. Modules have different settings and different tasks.

With **Inventory,** it is possible to configure general settings which data RealMigrator will collect from a computer or a machine.

**File Module** and **PST Module** are about migration settings of files and PST files. Different settings are available to configure these modules and a migration in different ways.

Use **Custom Module** to customize a migration. This module can have several functions or roles. For example, a backup function.

With **Server Module,** it is possible to configure a PST Import.

All these modules also have a script function to customize a module in an own way.

**Folder list** is an additional chapter to File Module and PST Module.

**Own Blob Storage** contains an example of how to create an own Blob Storage for File module, PST module and/or Custom module.
